To modify the `client.publish()` call to publish the provided code instead of the build_payload() function, you can encode the provided code as a string and publish it. However, please note that MQTT messages typically transmit data rather than code, so it's unusual to send executable code over MQTT. But if this is specifically required for your application, here's how you could do it:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt
import json

mqtt_server_host = "172.20.10.4"
mqtt_server_port = 1883
mqtt_username = "mqtt-user"
mqtt_password = "Javier05"
mqtt_transport = "tcp"
mqtt_keepalive = 60
mqtt_client_id = "core-mosquitto"


def on_connect(client, userdata, flags, rc, properties=None):
    if rc == 0:
        print("INFO :: Connected to MQTT Broker")
    else:
        print("ERROR :: Connection failed:", rc)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Connect mqttv5 client
    client = mqtt.Client(client_id=mqtt_client_id, protocol=mqtt.MQTTv5, transport=mqtt_transport)
    client.username_pw_set(username=mqtt_username, password=mqtt_password)
    client.connect(host=mqtt_server_host, port=mqtt_server_port,
                   keepalive=mqtt_keepalive, properties=None)
    client.on_connect = on_connect

    try:
        # Convert the code to a string
        code_str = """# Import necessary libraries
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time

# Set the GPIO mode to BCM 
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)

# Define the GPIO pins for the ultrasonic sensor
GPIO_TRIGGER = 18  # Pin to trigger the ultrasonic sensor
GPIO_ECHO = 24     # Pin to receive the ultrasonic sensor's echo

# Set the GPIO pins as either input or output
GPIO.setup(GPIO_TRIGGER, GPIO.OUT)
GPIO.setup(GPIO_ECHO, GPIO.IN)

# Function to measure distance
def distance():
    # Send a short pulse to trigger the ultrasonic sensor
    GPIO.output(GPIO_TRIGGER, True)
    time.sleep(0.00001)
    GPIO.output(GPIO_TRIGGER, False)

    # Record the time when the ultrasonic sensor's echo is received
    StartTime = time.time()
    StopTime = time.time()

    # Wait for the echo to be received
    while GPIO.input(GPIO_ECHO) == 0:
        StartTime = time.time()

    while GPIO.input(GPIO_ECHO) == 1:
        StopTime = time.time()

    # Calculate the time taken for the echo
    TimeElapsed = StopTime - StartTime

    # Calculate distance based on the speed of sound (34300 cm/s)
    # Divide by 2 because the sound goes to the object and back
    distance = (TimeElapsed * 34300) / 2

    return distance

# Main program
if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        while True:
            # Call the distance function to measure distance
            dist = distance()
            
            # Print the measured distance in centimeters
            print("Measured Distance = %.1f cm" % dist)
            
            # Wait for 1 second before taking the next measurement
            time.sleep(1)

    # Handle Ctrl+C keyboard interrupt gracefully
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Measurement stopped by User")
        
        # Clean up GPIO pins before exiting
        GPIO.cleanup()"""

        # Publish the code as a string
        client.publish("/home/front_door/code", code_str, 0, retain=True)

    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Measurement stopped by User")

    client.loop_stop()
    client.disconnect()
```

This code will publish the provided code as a string to the MQTT topic "/home/front_door/code" when executed.
